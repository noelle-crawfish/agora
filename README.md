# Our project for SMHacks II, Agora a web application on a (theoretical) .tech domain
note: while we have applied, for a .tech domain, it has not yet finished processing

# In order to run this project, you need to set some environment variables
- PYTHONHASHSEED=0
- DATABASE_URL=yoururl (we're not giving you ours)
- FLASK_APP=application.py

# You also need to install
- python3
- all the requirements in requirements.txt
- psql

# So what technologies went into this?
- HTML and CSS (bootstrap and top hat themes)
- Python (flask, jinja2)
- postgresql (hosted on heroku)
- the wolfram alpha api
- coffee (lots)

# What's the point?
We noticed that on a daily basis, we find ourselves drowning in an endless sea of messages, trying to get the answer to that one problem that makes 0 sense. Agora aims to change this by creating a streamlined method of communication, and an easy way to check your work.
